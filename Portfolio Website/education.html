        <h1>Tejero Elemetary School</h1>
        <p>I completed my elementary education at Tejero Elementary School, <br>
            where I developed a strong foundation in academics and personal <br>
            growth. The school's nurturing environment and dedicated teachers <br>
            fostered my curiosity and encouraged a love for learning. I <br>
            participated in various extracurricular activities, which helped me <br>
            build teamwork and leadership skills. My time at Tejero Elementary <br>
            was instrumental in shaping my character and instilling the values <br>
            of discipline, respect, and perseverance that I carry with me today.</p>

        <p>
            I completed my junior high school education at USPF Mabini Campus, <br>
            where I was immersed in a dynamic learning environment that challenged <br>
            me academically and personally. This is where I started liking sports, <br>
            particularly badminton, and began participating in local intramurals. <br>
            he school's emphasis on holistic development allowed me to explore  <br>
            various subjects and engage in extracurricular activities, enhancing  <br>
            my critical thinking and creativity. With the guidance of dedicated <br>
            teachers and supportive peers, I developed valuable skills that prepared <br>
            me for future academic endeavors and shaped my aspirations for success.

        <h1>USPF Lahug Campus</h1>
        <p>
            I graduated from USPF Lahug Campus Senior High School, where I had the <br>
            opportunity to delve deeper into my academic interests and prepare for <br>
            the next steps in my educational journey. As an alumnus of the school, <br>
            I fondly remember the supportive environment that encouraged growth and <br>
            exploration. During my time there, I made the difficult decision to step <br>
            back from sports activities, allowing me to focus more on my studies and <br>
            personal development. The skills and knowledge I gained at USPF Lahug have <br>
            laid a strong foundation for my future endeavors.

        <h1>Cebu Technological University</h1>
        <p>
            I am currently pursuing my IT degree at Cebu Technological University (CTU), <br>
            where I am in my 2nd year of studies. This journey has been filled with <br>
            challenges, but I am determined to keep fighting and overcome the obstacles <br>
            I face. The rigorous coursework and hands-on experiences have enhanced my <br>
            technical skills and deepened my understanding of information technology. <br>
            I am grateful for the supportive community and resources available at CTU, <br>
            which motivate me to stay focused and strive for success in my academic endeavors.
